It is designed for employees of the bookstore to track, search and manage the bookstores inventory, events, orders, sales and user profiles.

## Status

Project is: \_inDevelopment.

This app is currently being worked on and has not hosted yet. Development is expected to finish in July/August 2019

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this was a friends mother who owns a bookstore called Orinda Books.

I wanted to write an application which had a backend and allowed the user to interact and create data.
