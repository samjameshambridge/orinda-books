## Introduction

This app is a mock up administration panel for a bookstore.

It is designed for employees of the bookstore to track, search and manage the bookstores inventory, events, orders, sales and user profiles.

## Technologies

This project uses:

- React
- Redux
- Firebase (cloud storage, authentication and NoSQL databases)
- CSS / SASS

## Status

Project is: \_inDevelopment.

This project is not finished. There is a lot of structural reorganisation that I would like to happen, a lot of features I would like to implement and a general improvement of the UX.

This app has been hosted (https://samjameshambridge.github.io/orinda-books/).

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this was a friends mother who owns a bookstore called Orinda Books.

I wanted to write an application which had a backend and allowed the user to interact and create data.
